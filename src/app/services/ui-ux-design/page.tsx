      question: "What's the difference between UI and UX design?",
      answer: "UI (User Interface) design focuses on the visual aspects of a digital productâ€”how it looks and feels, including colors, typography, layout, and visual elements. UX (User Experience) design addresses the overall experience and user journey, focusing on usability, accessibility, and solving user problems. While UI is about aesthetics and presentation, UX is about functionality and satisfaction. Our approach integrates both disciplines to create designs that are both beautiful and highly functional."
    },
    {
      question: "How long does a typical UI/UX design project take?",
      answer: "Project timelines vary based on complexity and scope. A simple website redesign might take 4-6 weeks, while a complex application could take 8-12 weeks or more. Our process includes research, wireframing, prototyping, testing, and refinement phases. We'll provide a detailed timeline during our initial consultation based on your specific project requirements."
    },
    {
      question: "Do you create responsive designs for all devices?",
      answer: "Yes, we design for all screen sizes and devices to ensure a consistent and optimized experience across desktop, tablet, and mobile. We use a mobile-first approach when appropriate and ensure that all designs adapt seamlessly to different screen sizes. Our responsive design approach prioritizes usability regardless of the device being used."
    },
    {
      question: "How do you ensure your designs align with our brand?",
      answer: "We begin with a thorough review of your brand guidelines, values, and existing materials. If you have an established brand, we ensure our designs align with and enhance your visual identity. If your brand needs development, we can help refine or create brand elements that reflect your company's vision. Throughout the process, we maintain open communication to ensure the designs authentically represent your brand."
