## Placeholder Usage

Until you have actual team photos, you can use stock photos or generated images that fit professional headshots. Make sure you have the rights to use any images you include.

## Image Requirements

The team member cards are designed with round cropping, so the key facial features should be centered in the image. Leave some margin around the face to ensure proper display in the circular crop.
